Our solution is to add an AEB Controller for the car and integrate it with the Baseline Driver.
The solution arises from our AEB System Design, which is written materials/CR24_STAR_R1.pdf. There is also a video that visualizes our results.
Optimization:
- Avoid parachute brake to move more smoothly
- Be able to follow the given route perfectly
- Immediate continue run smoothly when the preceding vehicle starts to move
